Data Arch
- Consider passing structs as const reference instead of by value
- Apply const correctness

Data Structure
- Add Operators to Vertex
- Always use Vertex instead of x y
- Review Quad and Rect init and updates

Immediate
- Ship Direction Vector
- Abstraction and Rewrite
- Propulsion Particle Effect
- Turn Animation
- Add error headers from a past project

Resources
- Run HGE "PNG Optimizer" pngopt.exe *.png

Design - Upgrades
- Radar to display some minimap
- Different kind of radars and minimaps for different tasks.
- Each radar is specialized but can still be configured

Ideas
- DF like survival and base building using
	- Day/Night cycle as the sun is hidden by a planet or moon
	- Build a base to hide from the sun during the "day"
	- Most active at "night"
	- Once the base is built enought, add solar panels to harvest sun energy
	- Upgrades to allow operations when the sun is not hidden
