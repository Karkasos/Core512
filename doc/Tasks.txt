Immediate
- Ship Direction Vector

Ideas
- DF like survival and base building using
	- Day/Night cycle as the sun is hidden by a planet or moon
	- Build a base to hide from the sun during the "day"
	- Most active at "night"
	- Once the base is built enought, add solar panels to harvest sun energy
	- Upgrades to allow operations when the sun is not hidden
